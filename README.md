My reverse-engineering of the puzzle game [TIS-100](http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) by [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/). The font tis100copy was created with screenshots of the game and [BitFontMaker2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/). Still a work in progress (it's basically just at text editor at the moment). Visit [TakingItCasual.github.io](https://TakingItCasual.github.io) to see it in action.
